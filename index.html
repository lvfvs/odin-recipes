      Eggplant and Mushroom Rigatoni
    </a>
    <img src="assets/images/eggplant-mushroom-rigatoni.jpg" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A dish made after finding some eggplant and mushrooms which were sitting
      in the fridge for far too long. It is intended as a vegan take on
      bolognese.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pasta has a slightly sweet taste, given by deglazing the cooked
      ingredients with cabernet sauvignon and balsamic reduction.
