<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An easy, delicious summer pasta made with simple pantry ingredients.</p>
<p>
  The pasta has a bright flavour, and is perfect for a quick weeknight dinner.
  It's a nostalgic recipe for me, since Dad used to cook it for us all the time.
  I've since adapted the recipe for my older, more experienced palette, and love
  it just as much as I always did.
