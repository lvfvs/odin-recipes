<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This dish is for when a 3PM hang turns into a dinner party or when you've had
  too long of a day at work.
</p>
<p>
  But just because it's comfort food doesn't mean there aren't techniques.
  They're the same ones that go into every restaurant pasta you've ever loved:
  Salt the boiling water; cook the pasta al dente; create a silky sauce that
  marries pasta water, Parmesan, olive oil, and butter.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
  <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup olive oil</li>
  <li>3 oil-packed anchovy fillets</li>
  <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> tsp crushed red pepper flakes</li>
  <li>1 cup parmesan, grated</li>
  <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
  <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>fresh parsley, chopped</li>
  <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of a lemon</li>
  <li>a generous amount of lemon zest</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally,
    until very al dente, about 3 minutes less than package directions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Meanwhile, cook garlic and 1/4 cup oil in a large heavy pot over medium
    heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is golden, about 4 minutes. Add
    anchovies and red pepper flakes and cook, smashing anchovies with a wooden
    spoon to break them up, until anchovies begin to dissolve, about 1 minute.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cups pasta cooking liquid along with
    parmesan to pot with anchovies and garlic and cook, stirring, until cheese
    is melted, about 1 minute. Using tongs, add pasta to pot, then add butter
    and lots of black pepper. Cook, tossing energetically and adding more
    cooking liquid if needed, until pasta is al dente and sauce is thickened and
    coats pasta, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat; add parsley, lemon zest, and
    lemon juice.
  </li>
  <li>
    Divide pasta among bowls; drizzle with oil and top with more Parmesan.
  </li>
