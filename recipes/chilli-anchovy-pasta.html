<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This dish is for when a 3PM hang turns into a dinner party or when you've had
  too long of a day at work.
</p>
<p>
  But just because it's comfort food doesn't mean there aren't techniques.
  They're the same ones that go into every restaurant pasta you've ever loved:
  Salt the boiling water; cook the pasta al dente; create a silky sauce that
  marries pasta water, Parmesan, olive oil, and butter.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
  <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup olive oil</li>
